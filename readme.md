# Word Counter
By [EBUS Coding Club](https://github.com/ebus-coding-club)

Count the frequency of letters or words in a text file and show a graph.
## Requirements
- [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or higher
- [`matplotlib`](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib)
## Usage
Download the source code and unzip the downloaded file. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the source code directory to install the required packages. Create a text file in the same directory as `main.py` named `input.txt` and fill it with text you want to analyze. Run the script in an IDE of your choice or with `python main.py`.
## Objective
Given a text file, count the frequency (number of occurrences) of either letters or words, and show a bar graph to visualize the results. Do not include whitespace or punctuation in the results, with the exception of apostrophes that are inside words.
## Next Steps
- Add command line arguments for input file path and other options 
- Add timers for significant steps to diagnose performance
- Optimize speed and memory usage
- Anything else you can think of to improve the script
